## Objective
- 

# Linear Regression to Predict MPG
## Summary
- The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values would be the vehicle length and ground clearance variables. The P-value for vehicle length is 2.60e-12. The P-value for Ground clearance is 5.21e-08. These two variables would be statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to our linear model. In other words, vehicle length and ground clearance have significant impact on our model. 
- The slope of the linear model is not zero, given significant impact of the variables. 
- The R-squared for this model is 0.7149. Given this, we can conclude that statistically the data is a good fit for the model. The model does predict MPG of MechaCar prototypes effectively
